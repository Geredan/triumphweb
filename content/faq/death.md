Character death for Triumphs is only possible on the last day, after 22 hours
of play. We're hoping that that's enough time for everyone to find a
satisfactory arc for their character, whether they die at the beginning or the
end of the Games. Players will have full opportunity to enjoy the after-game
space and watch the Games proceed, or to relax in the spa facilities.

That said, if you feel there's unfinished business for your character, you
will have the opportunity to play some scenes with those who were important to
you in life. And there will be some characters available if you want someone
new to play for the remaining time.
