All combat will be handled narratively, not physically. While there may be
representations of your weapons, they are there to help you act out the
scenes, not to actually use in fighting. There will be no running around in
the woods, no hiding or sneaking up on people, no crowds of people beating
each other over the head with foam weapons.

As such, all roles are suitable for all levels of physical ability. It is
important to us to make sure that everyone will be on an equal playing field,
no matter how in shape you are, no matter whether you have a disability or
not.
