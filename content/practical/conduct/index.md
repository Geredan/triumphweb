Triumph larp is an event open to everyone over the age of 18 and values
everyone conducting themselves in a manner that is safe and inclusive for all
attendees. Please take a moment to review our Code of Conduct and
Anti-Harassment Policy.

<!--more-->

Codes of Conduct and Anti-Harassment Policies enable, guide, and encourage
safe and secure relationships between attendees. They help to make Triumph a
safer space by discouraging problematic behaviour and helping everyone to feel
comfortable.

This Code applies to all Triumph attendees and staff. We will also expect
those working for the hotel and other spaces to be treated, in line with the
principles of this Code of Conduct.

You will find references to our Safety Team throughout this Code of Conduct.
The Safety Team is a group of people whose mandate is to receive reports on
potential violations of the Code of Conduct. They can escalate issues as
appropriate, discuss issues in a confidential manner, and/or act as mediators,
according to the wishes of the person raising the issue.

## Expectations and Policy

Everyone involved with Triumph is expected to show respect towards all
attendees, as well as organisers, venue staff and the general public.

Triumph is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for all
attendees, regardless of ethnicity, gender identity and expression, sexual
identity or sexual orientation, neurodiversity, disability, physical ability
or appearance, race, age, religion, or fiction/fandom preferences (this list
is not exhaustive).

We do not tolerate harassment in any form. This extends to attendees, our team
and the venue staff. Behaviour that will be considered harassment includes,
but is not limited to:

* Intimidation, stalking, or following
* Unwelcome physical contact
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Comments intended to belittle, offend, or cause discomfort
* Photographing or videotaping members without their consent
* Sustained disruption of games or other events
* Sexually graphic or otherwise inappropriate images in public spaces
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour

We require Attendees to follow this code in online interactions, at all the
Triumph larp venues, and at all our social activities.

Attendees who are asked to stop any harassing behaviour must comply
immediately. Further action as approrpiate may be taken by our Safety Team.

## Reporting

*Before the larp*: You can report harassment or other Code of Conduct violations
by email to safety@triumphlarp.org This address will be continuously monitored
by our safety team.

*At the larp*: If someone has harassed you or breached this Code of Conduct in
any way, or if you have witnessed or become aware that harassment or a Code of
Conduct breach has taken place, please ask that person or persons to stop – as
long as it is safe to do so and if you feel comfortable enough to make the
request. To help us identify patterns of behaviour and possible repeat
offenders, we would be grateful if you would also report the harassment to the
organizers and/or safety team immediately.

If you do not want to speak to the person(s) directly, or if you engage with
them and the harassment or Code of Conduct breach does not stop, please report
the issue as soon as possible to our Safety Team. Alternatively, you can
report by email.

Harassment and other Code of Conduct violations reduce the value of Triumph
for everyone – we want you to be happy at our event, so please do speak to us
if needed.

### What will happen if you make a report?

When taking an in-person report, the team will first ensure that you feel safe
and cannot be overheard. Once you in a secure location, we’ll ask you to tell
us about what happened, and what you would like to happen next. We understand
this can be upsetting, but we’ll handle it as respectfully as possible and try
to support you. You can also bring another person to support you if you wish.

If you submit a report by email, our team will respond to you as quickly as
possible, and proceed at their discretion, based on the content, context and
wishes expressed in your email.

However you choose to report an issue, you won’t be asked to confront anyone,
and we will do our best to protect your identity if we take action as a result
of your report. Details of your complaint will only be disclosed to the team
who are dealing with it. We will keep you advised of the progress we’re making
in handling the issue, and of any action we decide to take. We will take into
account your views when deciding on that action. However, please be aware
that, if you report a serious criminal matter, or we believe that you or
someone else may be in danger, we may need to contact the police as others as
appropriate. We will take into account any concerns you may have around
involving them.

The Triumph Safety Team has the right to take any actions needed to keep our
event a welcoming environment for all attendees. Measures taken may include
warning the offender, mediating solutions between parties, or taking any other
action the team considers necessary, up to and including expulsion from the
larp with no refund.

If you wish to take further steps following your report and our response, our
team will be happy to help you contact hotel/venue security, local law
enforcement, local support services, or otherwise assist you to feel safe for
the run-up to and duration of the event. Above all, we want you to feel
valued, safe and included at Truimph.
