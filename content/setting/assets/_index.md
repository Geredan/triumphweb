Here we've provided assets for your use, whether for costuming or art design or
whatever you would like to do with them.

# Art Policy

It is our sincere wish that the players of *Triumph* engage with and create
the world of the Imperium along with us, the organizers, and a critical part
of that is being able to create art within the setting of the world.
Accordingly, you are free to use and share works based on these assets, as
well as any other art or music or costume elements you would like to create
within the setting. We are commited to doing whatever we can to help you in
this, whether by making source files available or incorporating your work
into the setting or anything else.

Larps are acts of cocreation. While a few things are designed and set in place
by us — the structure and timing of the event, for example — almost
everything else is a place where you are encouraged and welcome to add your
own details. We may have set the broad stokes of this universe, but you are
the ones who will be giving it life, and we want to ensure you feel empowered
to do so.

# The Imperium Seal

This is the official seal of the Imperium. You can download it in SVG format
by clicking on it.

# Canton Icons

These are informal icons used to indicate each Canton. They are infrequently
used in the Capital, but are very common throughout the Cantons as a kind of
visual shorthand. Their simple outlines makes them flexible, easy to
embroider on fabric or stencil on walls, and they have a slight anti-Imperium
feel about them to most of the powers-that-be.

You can download the SVG by clicking on it, and each Canton is labeled
separately afterwards for reference.
