We, the organizers of *Triumph*, are pleased to announce *The Winter
Games*! *The Winter Games* are three online larps, all prequels to our live
game running in November, 2022. While they form an historical and atmospheric
background to *Triumph* participation in the Winter Games is not essential in
order to enjoy the in-person larp to the full.

<!--more-->

The games will each accommodate about 20 players, and will be played
in early 2022 over Discord. All games will be free to join and play. The are
open to all, although preferential space will be given to those playing
in *Triumph* and those on the waitlist for the game. We will be running
scenarios based on the relative interest in each one; with enough interest we
may run some scenarios two or even three times. You are welcome to sign up
for multiple scenarios and multiple runs, and we will accommodate as many
players as possible.

You can express your interest by [filling out our form](https://airtable.com/shrEhNxGNywoYMAag).
We will gather the results and schedule the larps within a few weeks, and we
will have a subsequent signup for each individual game. And of course, if you
are interested in joining the waitlist for the live game in November, you can
do so [here](https://airtable.com/shrGN23tg93chHQuu).

The scenarios are listed below.

Seven Youths for Seven Maidens
------------------------------

The war is over. The Eternal City won, and the Cantons lost. It was a
close-run thing and both sides sustained huge losses. Now representatives
from the 12 Cantons are in the Eternal City to negotiate peace terms. The
winning side, obviously, has the upper hand but can’t afford to let the
losers discover just how weakened they are. The Cantons will try to get as
favourable terms as they can. They have very little left to offer and some
have only reluctantly laid down their arms. Both sides are battered, neither
has much to give. The Eternal City asks each Canton to provide seven youths
and seven maidens, annually, as a sacrifice. This is the beginning of the
Triumphal Games …

*Cast*: Up to 12 representatives, one from each Canton and up to 8 characters
representing the Eternal City. Not all these slots need to be filled.

This is a highly political game with each participant having a specific agenda
to put forward. Some in the Eternal city have sympathy with the Cantons, some
in the Cantons have always been aligned with the Eternal City. Matters are
not simple. Alliances will be made and broken. Betrayal is a distinct
possibility.

---

Bribery and Corruption
----------------------

It is 23 years since the end of the war. The Eternal City has recovered and
the Cantons are thoroughly suppressed. Out in the Arena there is a clear
favourite, outshining the other Triumphs. Corporate heirs with more money
than sense are betting heavily. However, on the third day, the favourite is
killed in what seems to be a stroke of luck in the Triumph from Canton 9’s
favour. Was it luck? Or was one of the Gamekeepers corrupted? What will
happen if he or she is found guilty? If they are executed, who is sickened
and who celebrates?

*Cast*: Up to 12 mentors, 4 gamekeepers, up to six heads of or heirs to
corporations.

---

The Killing Floor
-----------------

24 Triumphs go head to head in the arena.  Who will be the Victor?

This scenario has no pre-defined plot. Players will be able to design their
own characters and plot with the other Triumphs during the days prior to the
game. The actual game will play out along consent lines, using a modified
form of the mechanic we will be using for the in-person larp.

*Cast*: up to 24 triumphs.
