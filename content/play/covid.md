Owing to COVID-19, the game has been moved to Nov 18th-Nov 21st, 2021 at the
same location as before. <!--more --> We hope — along with the rest of the
world — that it will be possible to gather safely at that time.

Obviously, we have no better information than you do as to what the world will
actually look like. The safety of our players and our organizers is our top
priority; we will be monitoring all recommended guidelines and following them
to ensure as safe an event as possible. We are very optimistic that we will be
able to run the game we envision in 2021, and will keep you informed of any
changes we need to make, should there be any.

If you have any specific safety concern in relation to COVID-19 or for that
matter any other safety concern please do contact us at safety@triumphlarp.org
