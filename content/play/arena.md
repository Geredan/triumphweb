Here's our plans for how the combat in the Arena is going to work.

<!--more-->

First, we want to be clear about our design for the players who have signed up
to play Triumphs. This is a game where all of your characters, save one, are
going to die on the final day. We're expecting the Arena to take roughly
eight hours to play out; that means more than half of your characters will
die at least four hours before the game officially ends, and some of you will
be leaving in the first hour of the Games. You will have an opportunity to
volunteer for a time when it makes the most sense for your character's
story — and we strongly recommend you steer towards a dramatic loss — but if
there are no volunteers the loser of any given combat will be randomly chosen.

We will have a space for Triumphs to hang out if their character is
eliminated, and you will be welcome to hang out in your room or the off-game
room or spend time in the spa. There will also be opportunities to play out
some scenes with characters you were close to. In some cases we may be able
to provide a secondary character to allow you to reenter the game in the
Capital, but we may not be able to provide that for everyone who wants it.

We hope that was clear to you when you signed up as a Triumph. This is a game
about oppression, and within it the story of the Triumphs is about being
celebrated while at the same time being utterly disposable.

If you weren't aware of those conditions, or you decide there is something you
are uncomfortable with about the way combat is going to be handled, please
let us know immediately. We will work with you to find another character for
you to play within the game. As usual, if you have any questions or would
like to discuss any of this with us, please reach out on Discord or email.

# The Arena

The final day of the larp, the Triumphs will be taken into the Arena, where
they will be eliminated over the course of the day until only one remains. We
were initially planning on renting a separate venue for the Arena, but the
hotel underwent some remodeling over the past few years and we'll be able to
run the Games in the same hotel where the Capital is, which greatly
simplifies the logistics of the event.

We expect the Games on the final day to last roughly eight hours. This means
there will be about three eliminations each hour. We're still working out the
exact timetable; if we fall behind schedule there may start to be multiple
eliminations per combat — the Gamekeepers have many ways to increase the
lethality of the Arena — and it's not unknown for drones or hunter-seeker
robots to enter the Arena if the action isn't happening at an optimal pace.

In the Arena, the larp will be switching to a different style of larp. Rather
than the less structured, ongoing play of the first two days, combat will be
handled through a series of discrete scenes where the result is determined at
the beginning of the scene. These scenes will be recorded and broadcast to
the players throughout the hotel. The video will not be available outside the
hotel, and any subsequent released will be cleared with all participants
under the same conditions as any photographs from the event. Players will
have the power to veto the public release of any media in which they appear.

The following sections explain the rules we're going to use to resolve combats
in the Arena. Don't feel like you need to study or memorize them; we'll
explain all this and the organizer team will be responsible for enforcing
them at the at the larp. They are designed to be simple to understand in play
and serve to reinforce the emotional play, not replace it. Here are the key
points:

1. As a Triumph, you'll be able to form teams, but the number of Triumphs
permitted on a team will shrink over the course of the Games.

2. We'll use Discord to let Triumphs communicate with their Mentor while
they're in the Arena. They won't be able to communicate with other players.

3. When a combat occurs, the participants will have an opportunity to
volunteer to die. In the event no one volunteers, the victim will be randomly
chosen. The combat will then be acted out, and broadcast back to the
Capital.

4. There will be two ways to gain an advantage in a combat. All Triumphs
will be able to choose a type of weapon they are skilled with — if you manage
to acquire one, you will have better odds of surviving any given encounter.
Likewise, there will be occasional supply drops into the Arena. If you have
one, it will provide a one-time bonus to a single combat.

More detailed explanations of these rules are below.

## Teams

It's common for Triumphs to band together in groups in the Arena. The
Gamekeepers permit this, within certain limits. At the start of the Games
there is a maximum of six players on each team; over time the cap will be
reduced to increase competitiveness.

In the larp, any Triumph will be able to create a team by requesting one from
the Gamekeepers; this makes them the Team Leader. Any Triumph can join a team
with the consent of the Team Leader. Likewise any Triumph can unilaterally
leave a team, or be removed by the Team Leader. You will be warned if you are
joining a team with more than the recommended cap — the Gamekeepers have been
known to send drones to cull the herd if teams get above the approved limit.

Mechanically, when encounters happen in the Arena, you have a lower chance of
being at risk if you are in a team. This will not increase your chance of
surviving if you do get selected in the Arena, but will decrease your chance
of being selected in the first place. There's safety in numbers.

## Communication

Communication during the Games will be handled through Discord. There's a
channel for each Canton which includes both Triumphs and their Mentor. You
will be able to use text and voice (and possibly video, if we can verify the
available bandwidth). Triumphs are not permitted to communicate over any
other channels during the Games; we will be blocking them from the other chat
channels while the Arena is running.

If you are playing a Triumph or a Mentor and do not have a device capable of
running Discord, let us know and we will make arrangements for you to use
during the Games.

Mentors will have access to the resources of the Capital, as well as the other
Mentors. They will be responsible for trying to arrange resources for their
Canton to be sent into the Arena, and for acting as the liaison between the
Gamekeepers and the Triumphs.

## Anatomy of a Fight

These are the stages of combat:

1. Sides will be determined. Players are welcome to offer to fight; otherwise
this will be largely random, but with additional weight being given to those
who haven't participated in a combat in a while. A single team has the same
chance of being chosen as a single individual.

2. The participants will be determined. In the case of an individual, they are
the participant. In the case of a Team, someone on the Team can volunteer,
otherwise one member of the team will be randomly determined. In some cases,
more than one participant may be chosen.

3. Any advantages (weapons and supplies) will be added, and the losing side
will be determined randomly.

4. At this point, any Triumph can volunteer to die in the combat in place of
any of the losing side.

5. There will be a brief discussion of how the combat will be acted out.

6. The combat will be acted out for the cameras.

7. There will be a short break while we return to the first step. Those who
died will be given time to have a death scene before they are escorted out.
This may involve having a camera and broadcasting it back to the Capital, if
that can be arranged.

## Advantages

There will be two direct ways those in the Capital can influence the Games: by
providing weapons and by providing supplies to Triumphs. These need to be
arranged through the Gamekeepers. Once arranged, the Triumph will receive
either a larp-safe physical representation of the weapon or a prop
representing the supplies they have received.

These items can be freely traded within the Arena. They have to be voluntarily
given up by players (no stealing items out-of-character). They can only be
used during a combat. In the case of weapons, they must be in the possession
of the participant at the beginning of the combat, and the participant must
be skilled in its use. In the case of supplies, anyone can use them to help.
You can only benefit from one weapon and one supplies in each combat.

The base chance of surviving a combat is roughly 50%. If you have one
advantage, it will increase to roughly 60%. If you have two, it will be
roughly 70%.

There are three weapon classes: **swords**, **axes**, and **bows**. Triumphs
will have an opportunity to choose one to be skilled in before the Games
start, and this information will be public. You may not change your choice
during the Games.

If you die, any weapons or unused supplies you have go to your team leader. If
you are not part of a team, they go to the person who killed you.

# A Warning

We are still working out the specific details of the Arena. We may be required
before or during the Games to change how some of these rules work — the
Gamekeepers rarely feel particularly bound by tradition. In all cases we will
warn you as soon as we can, and we will aim to make the minimum changes
necessary to run the Games.
