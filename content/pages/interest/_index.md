Triumph is a larp inspired by *The Hunger Games*. 65 players will be arriving
in The Eternal City. 24 will be Triumphs, to train and be shown off to the
Imperium. 12 will be their mentors, tasked with guiding them through the
politics of the capital. The remainder will be Citizens of the capital,
stylists and media representatives and operators with their own plans and
agendas.

The larp will be played over three days. The first day will be the arrival of
the Triumphs at the capital. The second will be training and politicking. The
final day will be the games themselvesâ€”the Triumphs will be taken to an arena
where they will fight to the death, with everyone else watching and attempting
to influence the outcome.
